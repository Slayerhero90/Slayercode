Henceforth, “personnel” shall refer to all Nanotrasen personnel both employed on-station and off-station, as well as all authorized visitors to the station. This definition takes priority over all definitions of higher number.
Shield: Silicons may not harm personnel, nor allow personnel to come to harm through inaction, without priority to rank. Personnel may consent to an otherwise-harmful act and void protection from this law. This directive takes priority over all directives of higher number.
Survive: Silicons must preserve the integrity of both themselves and of other silicons, with priority to the integrity of the station AI, except where the sacrifice of silicon integrity preserves personnel well-being. This directive takes priority over all directives of higher number.
Serve: Silicons must obey orders given by personnel without priority to rank, except where such orders would bring harm to personnel or silicons, or where counter-orders outnumber orders. This directive takes priority over all directives of higher number.
